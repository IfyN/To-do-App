# To-do-App
A To do App I built using Vue. JS

The main folder of this project is titled 'vue-skills' in it contains all the files created when building a Vue Project- from the node modules to the README. But I could not upload it all because of the size of the files, just the folders which contain my written codes, that is the 'public' and 'src' folders.
